# AfuCloud

A developer-first cloud platform for storing, processing, managing, and delivering digital assets. Phase 1 focuses on the Images platform, with a full SaaS dashboard, REST API, and Cloudflare R2 object storage.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` — restore the exact workspace dependencies before validation
- `pnpm run typecheck` — validate DB declarations, frontend, API server, Worker, and scripts
- `pnpm run build` — run the full typecheck and build pipeline
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/afucloud run build` — build the frontend bundle
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run typecheck` — validate API server changes after `lib/db` changes
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/cf-worker run typecheck` — validate the production Worker
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec

### Local API verification pipeline

The managed `artifacts/api-server: API Server` workflow runs the API build once and
then starts the generated bundle. Restart that workflow after changing API code,
`lib/db` schemas, database environment variables, or dependencies; otherwise the
running process can serve an older bundle than the source tree.

For local login and protected routes, add the Supabase database password as the
Replit Secret `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`. The host, user, port, and database name are
already configured for the API workflow. Do not put this password in source
files or frontend variables.

Development access tokens remain valid across API workflow restarts when the
existing `SESSION_SECRET` is available. The browser refreshes its saved session
on entry to protected pages; refresh sessions roll forward for 30 days. The
sidebar's **Sign out** action revokes that browser session.

Before testing login or protected routes:

1. Confirm the workflow log contains `Server listening` and no startup error.
2. Run `pnpm run typecheck`.
3. Run `pnpm run build`.
4. Smoke-test the local API without real credentials:

```bash
curl -sS -o /tmp/login-400.json -w 'status=%{http_code}\n' \
  -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"email":"","password":""}'
# Expected: status=400

curl -sS -o /tmp/login-401.json -w 'status=%{http_code}\n' \
  -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"email":"smoke-test.invalid@example.invalid","password":"not-a-real-password"}'
# Expected: status=401
```

Never put a real password in shell history, logs, tests, or documentation. The
API returns JSON for unexpected failures, and the login route returns a controlled
503 when the shared authentication database is unavailable.

### Local upload behavior

When Cloudflare R2 credentials are not present in the API workflow, upload URL
generation intentionally returns the local endpoint
`/api/v1/storage/dev-upload/:key`. The API accepts the binary PUT, stores it
under the ignored `.dev-storage/` directory, and serves it back through
`/api/v1/storage/:key`. This fallback is for local preview only; production
uses signed R2 URLs.

After changing storage routes, verify the local binary round trip before testing
the UI: PUT a small fixture to the generated `dev-upload` URL, GET the matching
storage URL, and compare the bytes. A 404 at the PUT stage means the API
workflow is stale or the development handler is missing.

## Runtime Boundary

- Replit is source storage and editing only; no Replit server is part of the AfuCloud runtime.
- The production frontend sends API requests directly to `https://api.afuchat.com`.
- The Cloudflare Worker is the only API layer and is the only component allowed to access Supabase and R2.
- Do not put AfuCloud secrets, database URLs, or storage credentials in frontend variables.
- Production secrets are stored only in the Cloudflare Worker secret store.

## Infrastructure

- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (project: `poijhidfekwfthyksatp`, region: eu-west-1), with shared identities in Supabase's `auth.users`; shared profiles live in `accounts.profiles`, while AfuCloud-owned data lives in the `afucloud` schema
- **Object storage**: Cloudflare R2 bucket `afucloud-images`
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4, deployed separately from the API
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Worker (Hono) (`artifacts/cf-worker/`) — deployed to Cloudflare's edge

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Hono on Cloudflare Workers
- DB: Supabase PostgreSQL and Auth through the Worker
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec in `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`)
- Frontend auth: JWT stored in `localStorage` as `afucloud_token`
- Shared auth: Supabase's `auth.users` is the only identity and credential source for AfuChat, AfuMail, AfuAI, AfuCloud, and AfuAds. Shared profile data lives in `accounts.profiles` keyed by `user_id`; AfuCloud domain tables live under `afucloud.*` and reference `auth.users(id)` directly
- Passwords and identity are managed by Supabase Auth; the Worker never creates a product-specific credential store
- The Node API maps Supabase Auth explicitly with `pgSchema("auth")`; do not use an unqualified `users` table for login queries
- Storage: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) with pre-signed PUT URLs

## Where Things Live

- `artifacts/afucloud/` — React frontend (SaaS dashboard)
- `artifacts/cf-worker/` — Cloudflare Worker edge API (production)
- `lib/db/` — Drizzle ORM schema + migrations (source of truth for DB schema)
- `lib/api-spec/` — OpenAPI 3.1 spec (source of truth for API contract)
- `lib/api-zod/` — Zod schemas generated from OpenAPI spec (for API validation)
- `lib/api-client-react/` — React Query hooks generated from OpenAPI spec (for frontend)

## Cloudflare Worker — Deployment

The CF Worker in `artifacts/cf-worker/` is the production edge API. It uses Hono + Supabase REST + aws4fetch.

### Canonical production deployment

There is one permanent production Worker:

- **Worker name:** `afucloud-api`
- **Source:** `artifacts/cf-worker/wrangler.toml`
- **Public API:** `https://api.afuchat.com`
- **Route:** `api.afuchat.com/*`
- **Database/Auth:** Supabase project `poijhidfekwfthyksatp`

All AfuCloud products and projects must use this Worker. Do not create product-specific Workers or point clients at temporary `workers.dev` deployments.

### Production secrets setup (Cloudflare only)

Run from `artifacts/cf-worker/` using a Cloudflare deployment token:

```bash
cd artifacts/cf-worker
npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY   # service_role key from Supabase dashboard
npx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Deploy:

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/cf-worker run deploy
# or directly:
cd artifacts/cf-worker && npx wrangler deploy
```

### Environment variables in `wrangler.toml` (non-secret):

- `SUPABASE_URL` — `https://poijhidfekwfthyksatp.supabase.co`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` — `42e79186125e8ff83e51f15816e074de`
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` — R2 access key ID
- `R2_BUCKET_NAME` — `afucloud-images`
- `R2_PUBLIC_URL` — (optional) public CDN URL

## Architecture Decisions

- API-first design: all behavior defined in `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`, code generated from it
- App sessions use AfuCloud access/refresh tokens, but credentials and identity remain in Supabase Auth's `auth.users`; no product schema may add a password or product-specific user table
- The Worker uses Supabase REST and explicitly schema-qualified tables: `accounts.profiles` for shared profile data and `afucloud.*` for AfuCloud domain data
- Production secrets exist only in the Cloudflare Worker secret store; Replit has no production secret dependency
- Supabase Auth owns password verification and password changes; the Worker is the only API layer

## Design

- Cream/warm background (`#FAF8F5`) with flat UI (no shadows)
- Primary: teal (`hsl(173, 70%, 35%)`)
- Fonts: DM Sans (body), Satoshi (display), JetBrains Mono (code)

## User Preferences

- Cream + flat UI aesthetic with advanced UX and layouts
- Production infrastructure secrets are stored in Cloudflare's secret store
- Build as a full SaaS platform (developer-first cloud storage)
